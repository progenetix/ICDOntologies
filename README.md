# ICDOntologies

The _bioontologies_ repository provides a list of mapping files in YAML format, as input for mapping combinations of ICD-O Morphology and Topography codes to single [NCIt neoplasm core](https://evs.nci.nih.gov/ftp1/NCI_Thesaurus/Neoplasm/About_Core.html) entities.

The repository is being developed by the [_Theoretical Oncogenomics_](http://wiki.progenetix.org/Wiki/BaudisgroupIMLS/) group at the [University of Zurich](http://uzh.ch). It reflects work performed for the [arrayMap](arraymap.org) and [Progenetix](progenetix.org) resources and as part of the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health ([GA4GH](http://ga4gh.org)).
